This is a neo4j cypher only php driver. The aim of this library is to make sending cypher query as easy as sending sql to the server. This library DOES NOT implement every rest endpoint of the server. Ohh, it also support laravel framework natively!

###Why cypher only
Following the development roadmap for neo4j graph database, cypher are going to be playing a huge role in communicating with the database. Hence, cypher query will be the future for neo4j. Hence, this library is designed with that in mind.

For more information about cypher query language, you can [refer to the official cypher query language documentation](http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/cypher-query-lang.html).

Most application programming interface(API) of this library are inspired by laravel database adapter.

##Requirement
1. PHP 5.4 and above
2. Neo4j 2.0 and above
3. PHP Curl extension gi(highly recommended but optional)

If you are going to generate documentation with phpdocumentor (yes, it is integrated into the library) make sure that your machine can run phpdocumentor. [Here is a list of requirement for phpdocumentor](http://phpdoc.org/docs/latest/getting-started/installing.html).

##Installation
This library can be installed through composer. Just add the following to your `composer.json` and run `composer install`.
```json
{
	"require": {
		"endyjasmi/neo4j": "2.*"
	}
}
```
For laravel5, you may need to use this: 
```json
{
	"require": {
		"endyjasmi/neo4j": "dev-master"
	}
}
```


##Quickstart
Here is the easiest way to get started.
```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$neo4j = new \EndyJasmi\Neo4j;

$result = $neo4j->match('(n:Person)')
	->output('n', 'person')
	->run();

var_dump($result[0]['n']);
```
The `statement` method above will return a result instance which contains an array of rows returned from the server.

`$result[0]['n']` dumped above means that you want to get the first row and column `n` of the result. Columns name are determined from the cypher query where in this case, the query `return n` means return n.

Of course, this is but a basic usage. For more advance feature, do [refer to the wiki](https://github.com/endyjasmi/neo4j/wiki).

##Development
###Testing
In order to test this library, you can `git clone https://github.com/endyjasmi/neo4j.git`. Right at the root, you must `composer install --dev`. After that you can start testing manually by typing `vendor/bin/phpunit`.

In case you want to do a continuous test driven development(TDD), you can `npm install` from the root directory(you'll need nodejs installed). Then you can run `grunt` from the root directory. Then go ahead and play with the source, every time you save, the code will be tested.

###Documentation
If you want to generate documentation, you can run `grunt serve` which will generate a documentation on source first save. This means you just open any source file and save once. The documentation will be generated. Any subsequent save will trigger the documentation generation, which means it will always be latest(maybe slight delay).

##Hall of fame
So much for the title, it really is just the section to list all the people which have contributed to the project one way or another. So if you want your name to be here, you can start contributing to the project in any number of ways like refactoring, documentation, spell check, heck you can even ask me to put your name here.
